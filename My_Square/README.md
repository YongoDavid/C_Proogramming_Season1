# Welcome to My Square
***
In this peoject we will be creating a program to display a beautiful square 
this square will display (5,3) five columns and three rows

## Task
TODO - What is the problem? And where is the challenge?
The objective of this project is to craft a program that showcases a visually pleasing/beautiful square pattern. 
And ofcourse i will be using the the C programming language to carry this out.
we embark on a journey to construct a square that captivates the eyes.

## Description
TODO - How have you solved the problem?
to make our beautuuful square masterpiece, we delve into the intricacies of C programming. 
Our approach involves cleverly orchestrating a symphony of "o" characters and "|" strokes to sculpt the desired square shape. 
Through meticulous logic and precise execution, we breathe life into our creation, producing a square that exudes elegance and charm.
To achieve this feat, we harness the power of C's control structures and looping mechanisms.
Utilizing if statements and loops, we navigate the intricate pathways of our code, guiding the placement of each element
within the square canvas. With each iteration, the square takes form, each "o" and "|" carefully positioned to perfection.

## Installation
TODO - How to install your project? npm install? make? make re?
Embark on your journey to explore the beauty of the square by installing this project onto your local machine. 
Simply fork the repository from GitHub.
Another option is to download the Zip file, and you'll have everything you need to witness the magic unfold.
Then you can begin to play with this project.

## Usage
TODO - How does it work?
```
./my_project argument1 argument2
```
To experience the allure of our square creation, run the compiled program on your system.
Marvel at the intricacies of the "o" patterns and "|" strokes as they come together to form a breathtaking square display.
Experiment with different sizes and configurations to unlock the full potential of this C-powered masterpiece.
