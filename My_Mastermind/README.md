# Welcome to My Mastermind
This project , Mastermind is a game composed of 9 pieces of different range of colors.
A secret code is then composed of 4 distinct pieces.
The player has 10 attempts to try and find the secret code for the pieces.
After each input, the game indicates to the player the number of well placed pieces and the number of misplaced pieces.
If the player inputs and its failed then the player is given other tries till the amount of tries is reach or the correct pieces are gotten.

## Task
Your mission in Mastermind is clear: The task of is to get the secret code that is then composed of 4 distinct pieces .
The player has 10 attempts to find the secret code and if he fails he has to try again.
After each try/attempt, the game indicates to the player the number of well placed pieces and the number of misplaced pieces.
The Pieces will be in '0' '1' '2' '3' '4' '5' '6' '7' '8' order.
When the player finds the code with the right pieces, he wins the game, and the game stops.

## Description
In Mastermind, a misplaced piece is a piece that is present in the secret code but that is not in a good or right position.
The code must read the player's input from the standard input.
Your program will also receive the following parameters:
-c [CODE]: specifies the secret code. If no code is specified, a random code will be generated.
-t [ATTEMPTS]: specifies the number of attempts; by default, the playerhas 10 attempts.

## Installation
To install the Mastermind project, simply fork the repository from GitHub.
Or download the zip file directly to your local machine.
Follow the provided instructions to set up the project environment and start playing!

## Usage
For this project , Mastermind is developed using the C programming language, leveraging the power and efficiency it offers.
The core logic of the game is implemented using for loops, providing a structured approach to handling iterations and decision-making processes.
Additionally, pointers are utilized to enhance performance and memory management, ensuring smooth execution of the game logic.
